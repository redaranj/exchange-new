# Our mission and approach <a name="mission"></a>

Digital Security Exchange (DSX) staff, Advisory Committee members, and providers are committed to increasing the digital safety and security of community-based organizations, legal and journalistic organizations, civil rights advocates, local and national organizers, and public and high-profile figures who are working to advance social, racial, political, and economic justice in our communities and our world.

We pair civil society and social sector organizations with credible and trustworthy digital security experts and trainers who can help them keep their data and networks safe from exposure, exploitation, and attack.

**We will not work with, and reserve the right to refuse service to, anyone who espouses an agenda of hatred or division or who is not otherwise committed to the values set forth above.**

# How we work <a name="mission"></a>

**We are advocates for organizations in need of digital security assistance**. As such, we will work with those organizations to identify resources to enable them to conduct this work with participating providers. We provide support for building awareness, capacity, and skills to those who wish to jumpstart or accelerate their digital security work. Our intake and evaluation process ensures organizations are matched with participating digital security experts who best serve their contexts, needs, and goals.

Our staff works closely with the organizations and digital security providers we connect to ensure the highest quality service delivery.

When engagements are complete, we request voluntary feedback and incorporate findings into our services, processes, and platforms, in order to continually improve our work.

**Whenever possible, we refer organizations to providers within their communities as a first response**. We believe that the digital security providers who are already working within their own communities and are best equipped to meet the needs of those communities. We are here as a technical assistance and knowledge source, for those seeking additional support.

**We seek out, listen to, and partner with digital security providers from across many different contexts in order to inform and shape our work**. We prioritize working with those who have worked with or within civil society and the social sector, and who understand the needs, environment, and culture of these groups. Providers must opt-in to the DSX in order to be connected to organizations in need of assistance; we will not make connections to anyone who has not explicitly given their permission to take part in the Exchange.

**We equally balance the human and technology aspects of digital security management and provide frameworks to support change**. Each organization we work with has different needs. We place high attention to clearly defining what is most important to accomplish and making connections that directly address those goals, be they culture, process, or technology-based.
Our methodology and materials build upon expertise developed by providers in the field. They are free and open for use by anyone.

# Privacy, security, transparency, and accuracy <a name="privacy"></a>

We retain as little data as possible about our interactions with organizations and providers, and we prioritize keeping the information we do have safe, secure, anonymous, and free from attack. In some cases we will develop simple and secure records of organizations and providers in order to ensure the highest quality of service. In other cases, we will will retain no data at all. Organizations and providers can request that we retain zero data about our interactions, and we are developing secure and anonymous forms of intake and communications. More information about DSX’s privacy policy and approach to user security can be found [here](https://digitalsecurityexchange.org).

We will be transparent about how we develop, fund, and maintain DSX’s processes, systems, services.

# The technology we use <a name="technology"></a>

The DSX website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the static website engine. This increases security and helps us maintain a simple site. All of our assets (except the DSX theme) are licensed under the XX license and are freely available for use by similar projects. You can find our codebase on [GitHub](https://github.com/digital-security-exchange).

Our matchmaking platform is CDR, an open-source database and incident response system originally developed by our partners at [CiviCDR](https://civicdr.org/). The Digital Security Exchange, in partnership with [Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/), is a maintainer of the CDR platform and is actively developing new features and making them freely available to like-minded projects around the world. If you are interested in setting up your own DSX-like project, please contact us at [info@digitalsecurityexchange.org](mailto:info@digitalsecurityexchange.org).

# How we started and how we are funded <a name="funding"></a>

The Digital Security Exchange concept was first developed by Josh Levy after the U.S. presidential election in November 2016. It was a response to the increased demand for digital security capacity from U.S. activist groups, journalists, and social service organizations -- all of whom knew they needed to increase their security levels but didn’t know who to turn to for help.

In March 2017, after pulling together an initial working group and socializing and evolving the DSX concept, the project received a generous donation from an anonymous donor, providing crucial startup support. Soon after, the [Internet Systems Consortium](https://isc.org/) agreed to be be the project’s fiscal sponsor.

The project has since received support from the Mozilla Foundation, Omidyar Network Fund, and Small Media Foundation. Josh is also grateful for a fellowship with Stanford’s Digital Civil Society Lab, which provided crucial early support for the DSX project.
