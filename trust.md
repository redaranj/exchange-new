# Trust

At the core of what we want to do and how we interact with you, is trust. We understand that trust is not and should not be automatically granted. Here is how we plan to establish and keep your trust.

### Privacy, Security, and Confidentiality

- **No analytics**. We purposefully created a website and issue tracking system that does not contain any analytic software.

- **Data retention**. We will delete all information about your organization from CiviCDR, our issue-tracking platform, after work between organizations and providers is complete. With your permission, in order to maintain basic information about DSX-facilitated interactions, we will download an archive of this data for secure storage offline.  

- **Security.** Our priority is to ensure the security and privacy of our partners. Therefore, we have documented our internal security practices and approaches to technology design and intake [here](/security). 


### Technology

- **Open source**. We use and build technology that is free software/open source, because we want it to be available to everyone, everywhere, and because we can never fully verify the integrity of proprietary code; if malware exists in open source software, we can find it. In addition, we believe in the participatory philosophy of free software projects, including our own, which we encourage others to contribute to, audit, and use.

- **Privacy**. We use communication platforms that are built for privacy such as PGP and Signal to ensure that communications between us are encrypted.

[PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) stands for "Pretty Good Privacy” and is an [encryption protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption_software) that provides [cryptographic privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy) and [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) for [data communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_communication). PGP is used for [signing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature), encrypting, and decrypting texts, emails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of email communications. We use it to conduct private and secure conversations over email and to encrypt data submitted through our organizational and provider intake forms.

[Signal](https://signal.org/) is an encrypted communications application for iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, and Linux. It uses [mobile phone numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_number) as identifiers, and uses its trusted protocol to enable [end-to-end encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption) for communications with other Signal users


### Assessment

#### Organizations

- For organizations working with us to improve your digital security understanding and practices, we will review your organization’s information to confirm that the organization’s mission and goals align with our own (link), and that the contact is the appropriate source to make decisions on behalf of the organization.


#### Digital Security Providers

- Our current providers are known to DSX via previous work that the DSX or our Advisory Committee have engaged in. We only work with providers that exist within this "web of trust."

- For new or aspiring digital security providers, we will connect with the provider to understand experience and expertise areas, cultural sensitivities, company culture, and standard policies. We will reach out to current and former clients for feedback, investigate industry reputation, and understand the methodology used by the providers.

- When we do move forward with new and aspiring digital service providers, it will be initially within a  discreet “pod” program, in order for all sides to continuously assess fit and expertise.

### Review

Throughout the course of engagement with organizations and providers, the DSX communicates with all partners (as permissible) on the status of the engagement, gathering feedback on these main areas:

- Integrity
  - Conduct: Adherence to the DSX Code of Conduct
  - Contractual: Abidance to scoped & agreed-to project plan
  Communication: Maintenance of communication cadence, responsiveness to partner messages.


- Interaction & Respect
	- Partners that have acted in accordance and have received satisfactory reviews shall have a notation on their account on the CiviCDR platform.
	- Should we find that partners have acted in violation of our DSX Code of Conduct will be removed from our databases and future work with the DSX.
