# Support the Digital Security Exchange

Your support helps the Exchange continue to provide a unique service for journalists, nonprofits, NGOs, and other groups by connecting them directly to digital security experts who can help keep them safe online. 

We strive to support providers for travel, accommodations, and other fees associated with DSX-related engagements. Your donation today helps us continue to provide this crucial service. 

Note: Your donation is tax-deductible and will be processed by Internet Systems Consortium, our fiscal sponsor and a 501(c)(3) nonprofit
